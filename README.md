# Multiscale Computational Plasma Lab Website

This is the website for the Multiscale Computational Plasma Lab at UCLA, led by Prof. Luca Vialetto in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.

## About

Our research group focuses on developing advanced computational models to understand and predict the behavior of low-temperature plasmas and their interactions with materials. We combine fundamental plasma physics with practical applications in energy, manufacturing, and aerospace.

## Website Details

This website is powered by Jekyll and Bootstrap. It is based on a template originally created by the Allan Lab at Leiden University, which we have customized and modified for our group's needs.
