# Joining the group as a PhD student

**I am recruiting PhD students to join my group at UCLA.** I am specifically looking for curious, driven students who are interested in working on challenging, fundamental questions in plasma chemistry, transport phenomena, and computational modeling, as well their applications in electric propulsion, energy, and material processing. I encourage applications from students with strong mathematical and computational backgrounds, regardless of whether their prior training is in chemical engineering, physics, mechanical and aerospace engineering, applied mathematics, or related technical fields. If you are interested in working with me, please apply to the **UCLA graduate program** and mention me as a potential advisor in your application. You are also welcome to **email me directly at [vialetto@ucla.edu](mailto:vialetto@ucla.edu)** to express your interest.

# Joining the group as a postdoc

**I am looking for postdocs to join my group at UCLA.** If you have a strong research background in plasma physics, computational chemistry, transport phenomena, and/or numerical methods and are passionate about translating theoretical insights into practical, real-world impact, **please email me at [vialetto@ucla.edu](mailto:vialetto@ucla.edu)** with a brief description of your research interests and 3 representative papers.

# Joining the group as an undergrad or master's student

I look forward to working with UCLA undergraduate and master's student researchers. If you are currently at UCLA and would be interested in working with me, **please reach out via email at [vialetto@ucla.edu](mailto:vialetto@ucla.edu)** with a brief description of your background and research interests.
